# Portfolio

The frontend folder has the react application that contains my frontend logic and styling. It also contains my sanity backend schemas that are used to populate the components on my application.

The backend folder contains a mock Django backend for this application and what it would look like if I were to use Django instead of sanity's backend on this project.

The container folder contains a Docker yaml file and configurations to forward the mock django backend service and containerize it.
